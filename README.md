Passive safety monitoring app for people living alone. No daily check-ins required. Learns your patterns and alerts trusted contacts if something's wrong.

# Sweetpea App

**Living Alone Safety Monitoring Application**

A passive, intelligent safety monitoring app that tracks your activity across multiple devices (phone, laptop, watch, smart home) and learns your unique patterns. When unusual inactivity is detected, the system alerts you first, then escalates to your chosen trusted contacts if you don't respond. **No daily check-ins required** - it just works in the background.

## 🎯 The Problem

Millions of people live alone globally with no fixed routine or daily check-ins. If something happens to them - a medical emergency, accident, sudden illness - significant time could pass before anyone raises the alarm. For pet owners, this means their pets could be trapped for a long time with an unconscious owner. Current solutions require manual daily check-ins, which don't fit modern, unpredictable lifestyles.

## 💡 The Solution

**Set it and forget it.** Sweetpea learns your patterns across all your devices and only alerts if something is genuinely unusual. No daily tasks, no fixed schedules, no manual intervention required.

**Multi-device intelligence.** By monitoring multiple devices, we get a complete picture of your activity and can detect when something's genuinely wrong versus when you're just using different devices.
